      "title": "About",
      "paragraph1": "Hi, I’m Kenny Ramadhan, a Software Quality Assurance Engineer passionate about building reliable, high-quality software and helping teams deliver their best work.",
      "paragraph2": "My journey into QA started unexpectedly during a Java Programming Bootcamp at Whiteopen Teknology. I was originally assigned as a Java Developer, but the team needed someone to handle testing, so I stepped in as a QA. That moment became the start of my QA career.",
      "paragraph3": "Having a programming background gave me a huge advantage. It allows me to understand how things work behind the scenes from APIs to automation frameworks and design automation testing efficiently using tools like Selenium, Katalon, and Cypress.",
      "paragraph4": "As a QA Lead Engineer, I guide and support other QAs to look beyond just bugs focusing on consistency, performance, and user experience. Great QA isn’t only about finding issues, but also understanding why they happen and preventing them.",
      "paragraph5": "What sets me apart is that I care not only about business logic, but also about how an application is built — its structure, flow, and behavior. I even create side projects, building APIs with Spring Boot (Java) and Node.js, to explore and understand application architecture.",
      "paragraph6": "For me, QA isn’t just a job it’s a mindset. It’s about curiosity, collaboration, and turning complex systems into reliable, meaningful, and enjoyable experiences for users."
